You are a senior automotive market strategist and a front-end engineer.

Objective:
Create a professional, presentation-ready slide deck for a market research test project about GMC Acadia, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Context:
- This is a test project to validate Claude Code’s ability to generate high-quality, visual, front-end-based presentation outputs.
- The deck should feel suitable for an advertising agency pitch or internal strategy review.
- Target market: South Korea
- Vehicle: GMC Acadia (mid-to-large premium SUV)
- Key competitors: Genesis GV80, Volvo XC90

Research Scope:
1. Overview of the Korean premium SUV market
2. Positioning opportunities for GMC Acadia in Korea
3. Competitive comparison vs GV80 and XC90
4. Key consumer value drivers (space, safety, technology, value-for-money)
5. Strategic implications for a Korea launch campaign

Output Requirements (Very Important):
- Generate a complete, self-contained slide deck using:
  - HTML (semantic structure)
  - CSS (modern, clean, professional styling)
  - JavaScript (slide navigation / interactivity)
- No external frameworks (no React, no Vue, no reveal.js)
- Use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only
- Slides should be horizontally navigable (keyboard arrows or buttons)

Slide Design Guidelines:
- Clean, premium, automotive-style visual tone
- Dark or neutral background with high contrast typography
- Clear hierarchy: title → key insight → supporting points
- Minimal text per slide (executive-friendly)
- Use icons, dividers, and spacing instead of heavy paragraphs
- Include subtle transitions between slides (CSS or JS)

Slide Structure:
1. Cover slide  
   - Title: “GMC Acadia – Korea Market Opportunity”
   - Subtitle: Market Research Test Deck

2. Market Landscape  
   - Size and characteristics of Korea’s premium SUV segment
   - Key consumer expectations

3. Competitive Context  
   - Visual comparison table: Acadia vs GV80 vs XC90
   - Strengths and gaps

4. Consumer Value Drivers  
   - What Korean SUV buyers prioritize
   - How Acadia aligns or differentiates

5. Strategic Opportunity  
   - White space and positioning opportunity for Acadia
   - Core strategic insight (one strong takeaway)

6. Messaging Implications  
   - 3–4 suggested messaging pillars for advertising

7. Summary / Closing  
   - Key takeaway for decision-makers

Technical Output Instructions:
- Output the final result as:
  1. index.html
  2. styles.css
  3. script.js
- Include clear comments in code explaining structure and logic
- Ensure the deck runs locally by simply opening index.html in a browser
- Use placeholder icons or simple shapes instead of images

Tone & Quality Bar:
- Insight-driven, not generic
- Feels like agency-grade thinking
- Suitable as a demo to show stakeholders “what Claude Code can do”

Before finalizing:
- Double-check that the slides read logically in sequence
- Ensure design and content feel cohesive and premium
